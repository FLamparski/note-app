# NoteApp - "Interesting notes"

Notes, but a lot of interesting stuff happens off the UI thread.

## Iteration 1 - In progress

* [x] As a user, I want to add and view my notes
* [ ] As a user, I want my notes to be really fast
* [x] As someone who likes good aesthetics, I want my notes to look presentable,
  but the key priority is still speed
* [ ] As a real user, I want my notes to be persistent.

# Iteration 2 - Planned

* [ ] As someone who uses multiple devices, I want my notes to be accessible
  on all of them
* [ ] As someone who cares about privacy, I don't want the service owner to be
  able to read my notes
* [ ] As someone who uses trains a lot, I want my notes to not mess up on poor
  connections

# Iteration 3 - TBA
